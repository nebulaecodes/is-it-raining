# 🌧️ Is It Raining?

A weather app built with **vanilla JavaScript**, inspired by the question we all ask before stepping out: _"Is it raining?"_

This is my first personal project — it fetches real-time weather data and tells you whether it's raining in your city, with a friendly message and a calm aesthetic. If it's raining, you’ll get to see falling raindrops in the background. ☁️🌧️✨

## 🚀 How to Use
To run this app, open `script.js` and replace: `const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap. Then open index.html in a browser or deploy it to a static host.
